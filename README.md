# North Canterbury Metro Bus Service Query Library

## Obsolete!

This library utilised an unofficial API that was used by metroinfo.co.nz's web app. The API has been shut down and this library is no longer useful.

Metro now provide [an official developer API](https://www.metroinfo.co.nz/developer). It's based on [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) and is used by many apps including Google Maps. Please consider using a library like [npm:gtfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtfs).

Happy hacking!
